# TIDA_010042_PCB
KiCad project folder for a custom solar charge controller. All parts, footprints and 3D models are self contained in project libraries.

This modified design substitutes several components for equivalent parts due to supply issues. The board dimentions have been slightly reduced. The temperature and optical sensing circuits have been eliminated.
