# TIDA_010042_PCB
This is my KiCad project folder for a custom solar charge controller based off the TIDA-010042. All parts, footprints and 3D models are self contained in project libraries. Please reference the BOM file to see which parts, symbols, and footprints are included. Currently I am testing the stnadard reference design before starting the PCB design for this modified version. Please contact me if you have questions. 

This modified design substitutes several components for equivalent parts due to supply issues. The board dimentions will be slightly reduced and the temperature and optical sensing circuits will not be included.
